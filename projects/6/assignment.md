# Section 6: AdaBoost (Incomplete Section)

## Exercise 6.1: Boosting Classification

**Objective:**  
Implement AdaBoost for classification and evaluate its performance.

**Instructions:**
1. Load a classification dataset (e.g., Breast Cancer dataset).
2. Train an AdaBoost classifier with decision trees as the weak learners.
3. Compare the performance of the AdaBoost model with a single decision tree and a random forest.
4. Analyze the boosting effect and plot the model's learning curve.

**Deliverables:**
- Python code for training and evaluating the AdaBoost classifier.
- Performance comparison table for AdaBoost, decision tree, and random forest.
- A plot of the learning curve and analysis of the boosting effect.

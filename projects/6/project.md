Project: Sentiment Analysis

* Develop an AdaBoost classifier for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.
* Use a dataset like IMDB movie reviews or Twitter sentiment analysis dataset.
* Compare the performance of AdaBoost with other classifiers like decision trees and random forests.


## Objective
Develop an AdaBoost classifier for sentiment analysis of movie reviews, applying concepts from Section 6: AdaBoost.

## Dataset
Use the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

## Tasks
1. Data Preprocessing:
    * Load and explore the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset.
    * Perform text preprocessing: tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming/lemmatization.
    * Convert text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
2. AdaBoost Classifier Implementation:
    * Implement an AdaBoost classifier from scratch using Python.
    * Use decision stumps (one-level decision trees) as weak learners.
    * Implement the weight updating mechanism for misclassified samples.
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
    * Train your AdaBoost model on the training data.
    * Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Learning Curve Analysis:
    * Implement a method to visualize the learning curve of your AdaBoost model.
    * Analyze how the model's performance changes with the number of weak learners.
5. Feature Importance:
    * Implement a method to identify the most important features (words) in sentiment classification.
    * Visualize and discuss the top predictive words for positive and negative sentiments.
6. Comparison with Other Classifiers:
    * Implement the same classification task using a single decision tree and a random forest.
    * Compare the performance of AdaBoost with these classifiers.
7. Error Analysis:
    * Analyze misclassified reviews to understand the limitations of your model.
    * Discuss potential improvements based on this analysis.
8. Report:
    * Write a comprehensive report (max 3000 words) detailing your methodology, results, and analysis.
    * Discuss the effectiveness of AdaBoost for sentiment analysis and compare it with other ensemble methods.

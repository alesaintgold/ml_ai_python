## Exercise 4.1: Bagging vs Random Forest

**Objective:**  
Compare the performance of a bagging model and a random forest model on a classification problem.

**Instructions:**
1. Load a classification dataset (e.g., the Wine dataset).
2. Train a bagging model and a random forest model on the dataset.
3. Compare their performances in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
4. Discuss the impact of feature randomization in Random Forest on model performance.

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter notebook or Python script with code and comments.
- Performance comparison table for both models (accuracy, precision, recall).
- Discussion of the differences in performance and impact of feature randomization.

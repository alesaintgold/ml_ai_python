# Section 1: Decision Trees I

## Exercise 1.1: Classification with a Decision Tree

**Objective:**  
Implement a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library and apply it to a classification dataset, such as the Iris dataset. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using cross-validation and various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

**Instructions:**
1. Load the Iris dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a Decision Tree classifier and evaluate its performance.
4. Experiment with different max depth values and observe the changes in model performance.

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter notebook or Python script with code and comments.
- Performance evaluation table with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) for different max depth values.
- Visualizations, if applicable (e.g., confusion matrix, decision tree plot).

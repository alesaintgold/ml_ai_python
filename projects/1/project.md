# Project: Iris Flower Classification

* Implement a decision tree classifier to categorize iris flowers based on their features.
* Use the popular Iris dataset and visualize the resulting decision tree.
* Compare the accuracy of your implementation with scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier.

## Objective
Implement a decision tree classifier to categorize iris flowers based on their features, using the concepts learned in Section 1: Decision Trees I.

## Dataset
Use the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Tasks
1. Data Preparation: 
    * Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn or a CSV file.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
2. Decision Tree Implementation:
    * Implement a decision tree classifier from scratch using Python.
    * Use the ID3 or C4.5 algorithm for tree construction.
    * Implement appropriate stopping conditions as discussed in the course.
3. Model Evaluation:
    * Train your implemented model on the training data.
    * Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Visualization:
    * Create a visual representation of your decision tree.
    * Analyze the tree structure and discuss the most important features for classification.
5. Comparison with Scikit-learn:
    * Implement the same classification task using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier.
    * Compare the performance and tree structure with your implementation.
6. Report:
    * Write a detailed report (max 1500 words) discussing your implementation, results, and observations.
    * Include visualizations and performance metrics.

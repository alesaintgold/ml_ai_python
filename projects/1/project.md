### **Section 1: Decision Trees I**  
#### **Assignment Title: Classification with Decision Trees**

**Objective:**  
Implement and evaluate decision trees for classification tasks, and understand how hyperparameters affect model performance.

**Task:**
- Load the Iris classification dataset
- Implement a decision tree classifier using Python (from scratch or using `scikit-learn`).
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Experiment with different stopping conditions such as:
  - Maximum depth of the tree
  - Minimum samples required for a split
  - Minimum samples required at a leaf node
- Visualize the decision tree and interpret how it makes decisions.
- Analyze the effects of different stopping conditions on model accuracy and interpretability.

**Deliverables:**  
1. Python code implementing decision tree classification.  
2. Plots showing decision boundaries and the decision tree structure (if applicable).  
3. Performance evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, etc.) for different hyperparameters.

# Section 4: Introduction to Random Forest

## Exercise 4.3: Feature Importance

**Objective:**  
Use Random Forest to determine the importance of different features in a dataset.

**Instructions:**
1. Load a dataset with multiple features (e.g., Titanic dataset or any other suitable dataset).
2. Train a Random Forest classifier or regressor.
3. Extract and plot the feature importances.
4. Interpret the results and discuss which features are most important for the prediction.

**Deliverables:**
- Python code for training the Random Forest model and extracting feature importances.
- A plot of feature importances.
- A brief report interpreting the results.

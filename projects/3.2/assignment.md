# Section 3: Bagging

## Exercise 3.2: Bagging Classification with Decision Boundary

**Objective:**  
Implement bagging for classification and visualize the decision boundaries of the ensemble classifier.

**Instructions:**
1. Choose a classification dataset (e.g., the Breast Cancer dataset).
2. Implement bagging using decision trees as base learners.
3. Visualize the decision boundaries of the bagging ensemble and compare it with the decision boundary of a single decision tree.

**Deliverables:**
- Python code implementing the bagging ensemble for classification.
- Visualization of the decision boundaries of both the bagging ensemble and a single decision tree.
- Discussion of the difference between the decision boundaries.

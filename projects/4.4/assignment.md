## Exercise 4.4: Random Forest with Class Imbalance

**Objective:**  
Implement a Random Forest classifier for a dataset with class imbalance and apply techniques to handle this imbalance.

**Instructions:**
1. Choose a classification dataset with class imbalance (e.g., Fraud Detection dataset).
2. Train a Random Forest classifier and evaluate the performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Apply techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or class weights to handle the class imbalance.
4. Compare the model's performance before and after applying the balancing techniques.

**Deliverables:**
- Python code for implementing class imbalance handling techniques.
- Comparison table of model performance before and after applying balancing techniques.
- Discussion of the impact of handling class imbalance.

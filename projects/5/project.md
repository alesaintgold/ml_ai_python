# Project: Stock Price Prediction
# **Section 5: Boosting**
## **Assignment Title: Gradient Boosting for Regression**

* Implement a gradient boosting regressor to predict stock prices.
* Use historical stock data for a chosen company or index.
* Compare the performance of your gradient boosting model with other algorithms like random forest.

## Objective
Implement a gradient boosting regressor for regression and understand its advantages in terms of reducing bias. Predict stock prices, applying concepts 

## Dataset
Use historical stock data for a chosen S&P 500 company over the past 5 years, including features like opening price, closing price, volume, and various technical indicators.

## Tasks
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
    * Collect historical stock data using an API (e.g., yfinance) or a pre-existing dataset.
    * Create relevant features and technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI).
    * Handle missing data and normalize features as necessary.
    * Split the data into training, validation, and test sets (60% training, 20% validation, 20% test).
2. Gradient Boosting Regressor Implementation:
    * Implement a gradient boosting regressor from scratch using Python.
    * Use decision trees as base learners.
    * Implement gradient calculation and updating mechanism.
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
    * Train your gradient boosting model on the training data.
    * Use the validation set for early stopping to prevent overfitting.
    * Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
4. Learning Rate Analysis:
    * Experiment with different learning rates and number of estimators.
    * Visualize the impact of these parameters on model performance.
5. Feature Importance:
    * Implement a method to calculate feature importance in your gradient boosting model.
    * Visualize and analyze the most important features for stock price prediction.
6. Comparison with Other Models:
    * Implement the same prediction task using a random forest regressor and a simple ARIMA model.
    * Compare the performance of gradient boosting with these models.
7. Time Series Cross-Validation:
    * Implement time series cross-validation to more accurately assess model performance.
8. Report:
    * Write a detailed report (max 3000 words) explaining your methodology, results, and analysis.
    * Discuss the advantages and limitations of gradient boosting for stock price prediction.

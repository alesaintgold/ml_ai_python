# Section 5: Boosting

## Exercise 5.1: Regression with Boosting

**Objective:**  
Implement a Gradient Boosting algorithm for regression and evaluate its performance on a dataset (e.g., Boston housing data).

**Instructions:**
1. Load a regression dataset.
2. Train a Gradient Boosting model and evaluate its performance.
3. Compare the results with a traditional regression model like Linear Regression.
4. Plot the residuals and discuss the model's behavior.

**Deliverables:**
- Python code for Gradient Boosting regression.
- Performance comparison between Gradient Boosting and Linear Regression models.
- Plot of residuals and discussion of model behavior.

# Section 3: Bagging

## Exercise 3.1: Regression with Bagging

**Objective:**  
Implement a bagging ensemble method to perform regression on a dataset (e.g., Boston housing data).

**Instructions:**
1. Load a regression dataset (e.g., Boston Housing or any other regression dataset).
2. Implement bagging by training multiple regression models on bootstrapped samples of the data.
3. Compare the performance of the bagging model with a single regression model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) or another regression metric.
4. Visualize the predictions of the bagging ensemble.

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter notebook or Python script with code and comments.
- Comparison table of MSE or other regression metrics for bagging and single regression model.
- Visualizations of bagging ensemble predictions vs. true values.

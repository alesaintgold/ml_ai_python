### **Section 3: Bagging**  
#### **Assignment Title: Bagging for Regression**

**Objective:**  
Understand and implement Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) to improve the stability and accuracy of regression models.

**Task:**
- Implement Bagging (from scratch or using `scikit-learn`) by training multiple decision trees on bootstrapped subsets of the training data.
- Use a regression dataset (e.g., **California Housing** or **Airfoil Self-Noise**) to train the Bagging model.
- Compare the performance of the Bagging model to a single decision tree in terms of RMSE or MAE.
- Evaluate the Out-of-Bag (OOB) error for model selection and performance estimation.
- Experiment with different numbers of base learners and assess how the ensemble affects the model’s variance and bias.

**Deliverables:**  
1. Python code for implementing Bagging.  
2. Performance comparison of Bagging vs. a single decision tree (RMSE or MAE).  
3. OOB error plot and discussion of how Bagging reduces variance.  
4. A report analyzing the impact of Bagging on model stability and accuracy.

### **Section 4: Random Forest**  
#### **Assignment Title: Random Forest Classification vs. Regression**

**Objective:**  
Apply Random Forest models to both classification and regression tasks, and compare their performance to simpler models (e.g., decision trees).

**Task:**
- Implement a Random Forest classifier using `scikit-learn` and train it on a classification dataset (e.g., **Titanic** or **Iris**).
- Implement a Random Forest regressor and train it on a regression dataset (e.g., **Boston Housing** or **Diabetes**).
- Compare the performance of Random Forests to a single decision tree in both classification and regression contexts, using appropriate performance metrics (accuracy for classification, RMSE or MAE for regression).
- Investigate the effect of Random Forest hyperparameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf on performance.
- Examine how Random Forest handles missing data (if applicable) and compare with other imputation methods.

**Deliverables:**  
1. Python code for implementing Random Forest models for both classification and regression.  
2. Performance comparison (accuracy, RMSE, or MAE) between Random Forest and individual decision trees.  
3. Hyperparameter tuning results and analysis of their effect on model performance.  
4. A report discussing the advantages of Random Forest over single decision trees, including handling of missing data.

**Task:**
- Implement AdaBoost (from scratch or using `scikit-learn`) for a classification problem, using a dataset like **Iris**, **Titanic**, or **Wine Quality**.
- Train the AdaBoost model and evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Experiment with different base learners (e.g., shallow decision trees, SVMs) and observe the effect on model performance.
- Compare the performance of AdaBoost to other ensemble methods like Random Forest or Bagging.

**Deliverables:**
